  <h1>Evolution of machine learning</h1>
  <table class="paragraph">
    <tr>
      <td >
        <p>Because of new computing technologies, machine learning today is not like machine learning of the 
          past. It was born from pattern recognition and the theory that computers can learn without being 
          programmed to perform specific tasks; researchers interested in artificial intelligence wanted to see 
          if computers could learn from data. The iterative aspect of machine learning is important because as 
          models are exposed to new data, they are able to independently adapt. They learn from previous 
          computations to produce reliable, repeatable decisions and results. It’s a science that’s not new – 
          but one that has gained fresh momentum.
          <br>While many machine learning algorithms have been around for a long time, the ability to 
          automatically apply complex mathematical calculations to big data – over and over, faster and faster – 
          is a recent development. Here are a few widely publicized examples of machine learning applications 
          you may be familiar with:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The heavily hyped, self-driving Google car? The essence of machine learning.</li>
            <li>Online recommendation offers such as those from Amazon and Netflix? Machine learning 
              applications for everyday life.</li>
            <li>Knowing what customers are saying about you on Twitter? Machine learning combined with 
              linguistic rule creation.</li>
            <li>Fraud detection? One of the more obvious, important uses in our world today.</li>
          </ul>

  <h1>Benefits of Machine Learning</h1>
  <table class="paragraph">
    <tr>
      <td >
        <p>Most industries working with large amounts of data have recognized the value of 
          machine learning technology. By gleaning insights from this data – often in real time – 
          organizations are able to work more efficiently or gain an advantage over competitors.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <h2>Financial services</h2>
        <p>Banks and other businesses in the financial industry use machine learning technology for 
          two key purposes: to identify important insights in data, and prevent fraud. The insights 
          can identify investment opportunities, or help investors know when to trade. Data mining 
          can also identify clients with high-risk profiles, or use cybersurveillance to pinpoint 
          warning signs of fraud.</p>
      </td>
      <td>
        <h2>Government</h2>
        <p>Government agencies such as public safety and utilities have a particular need for machine 
          learning since they have multiple sources of data that can be mined for insights. Analyzing 
          sensor data, for example, identifies ways to increase efficiency and save money. Machine 
          learning can also help detect fraud and minimize identity theft.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <h2>Health care</h2>
        <p>Machine learning is a fast-growing trend in the health care industry, thanks to the 
          advent of wearable devices and sensors that can use data to assess a patient's health in 
          real time. The technology can also help medical experts analyze data to identify trends or 
          red flags that may lead to improved diagnoses and treatment.</p>
      </td>
      <td>
          <h2>Retail</h2>
          <p>Websites recommending items you might like based on previous purchases are using machine 
            learning to analyze your buying history.  Retailers rely on machine learning to capture 
            data, analyze it and use it to personalize a shopping experience, implement a marketing 
            campaign, price optimization, merchandise supply planning, and for customer insights.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <h2>Oil and gas</h2>
        <p>Finding new energy sources. Analyzing minerals in the ground. Predicting refinery sensor 
          failure. Streamlining oil distribution to make it more efficient and cost-effective. The 
          number of machine learning use cases for this industry is vast – and still expanding.</p>
      </td>
      <td>
        <h2>Transportation</h2>
        <p>
          Analyzing data to identify patterns and trends is key to the transportation industry, 
          which relies on making routes more efficient and predicting potential problems to increase 
          profitability. The data analysis and modeling aspects of machine learning are important tools 
          to delivery companies, public transportation and other transportation organizations.
